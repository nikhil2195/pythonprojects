# Back to Basics
## Mini-python projects for practice.

Learning a programming language is both the most exciting and the most humbling experience. And as every programmer knows, the best way to learn a language is to implement what you know so far i.e a project. But what happens when you don’t have a giant, ambitious project? For me, that’s where the sandbox comes in. Why not build a few sandcastles and work our way upto our grand castle?  

With that in mind, here are a few mini programming projects to get you started on learning any language. I personally am using python. There are various takes on these projects and mine is just one of them.If you're looking to brush up your programming skills this might help you out.

**ps:-I havent sorted out the projects yet.But I'll do it eventually.I'm just getting started :P**
